There are 2 ways to view results in Ciencias: viewing results as a whole or a single set of student answers.
<BR>
<BR>
Viewing results of a test depends on 3 things: the test file, the answer key, and the directory of answers. 
All of these will be consolidated into a single CTMR file. This CTMR file can be loaded in place of the above in order to view results.
<BR>
<BR>
After the CTMR file has been created, it can be loaded to view results. The overview screen shows how many students got each answer correct,
as well as the highest score, average score, lowest score, and most missed question. On the bottom center of the screen, the list of questions will appear. 
One can click on each question and click "view" in order to view more detailed information, including how many students answered each question.
Using the drop down box, one can sort by tag, or by how many students missed the question.

NOTE: You must download all the answer files from Google Drive Manually (for now). Also make sure that the answer key is separate from the rest of the answer files.
